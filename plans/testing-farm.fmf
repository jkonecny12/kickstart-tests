# This is TMT plan for running our kickstart tests on PRs with TFT resources
#
# This plan is harder to debug locally because repository needs to be cloned into the tests
# environment (VM). Much easier approach is to create target PR with your changes and check
# the TMT execution website which will guide you how to rerun the tests.
#
# If you really need to debug this locally follow these steps:
# 1. Create PR against rhinstaller/kickstart tests
# 2. Run `tmt run --all -vvv -e PR_NUMBER=<Pull Request id> provision --how virtual --memory 16384  # Don't go with memory under 3072 MB
#
# Steps above will start local VM which will clone your PR and execute tests on that code. It means
# that TMT plan data are taken from local but everything else is taken from the PR.
#
# To connect to the local VM spawned by `provision --how virtual` do:
#
#    ssh -p <port is printed during the provisioning step> root@127.0.0.1
#
# Inside the VM you can connect to virsh or podman running the tests.
#
# After multiple local runs I recommend you to cleanup by:
#
#    tmt clean
#
